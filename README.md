System Integration and Architecture is a subject that I expect will teach me how different parts of a system, like hardware, and software work together as one. I want to learn how to design and connect these parts so that they run smoothly and efficiently. This will help me understand the importance of planning and building systems that can help the community.

I also expect this subject to improve my problem-solving skills. When combining different systems, there are often issues like errors, slow performance, or parts that is compatible to each other. I look forward to learning how to fix these problems and how to design systems that can work well without hidden bugs. Activities such as projects and examples will help me practice and see how these ideas apply in real life.

Furthermore, I believe this subject will prepare me for future jobs in technology. Many companies today depend on connected systems for their work. By studying this subject, I hope to gain the skills to create systems that are both useful and reliable. In the end, I see this subject as an important step to becoming better at using technology to solve real-world problems.
